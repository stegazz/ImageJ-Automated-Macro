# ImageJ-Automated-Macro
This is a program that was requested by a friend when I started my journey in the programming world. 
My friend had a repetitive task of performing the same steps in ImageJ to extract tables analyzing images of pores in metallic components. 
Upon investigation, I discovered that ImageJ provides the ability to record macros (i.e., recording the actions performed within the program). 
With the ImageJ library, I was able to create a loop of the macro that repeats for each image folder. 
I'm sharing this program so that it can be helpful to other enthusiasts in simplifying their work.
